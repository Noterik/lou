Lou & Eddie
===========

Lou and Eddie (included javascript part) are the multiscreen toolkit part of Springfield. Its work in progress but the goal is
to allow development, packaging, distrobution and deployment of html5 based multiscreen applications. Its development was started
within the European linkedtv project (www.linktedtv.eu) and development will be helped by the EUScreen project (www.euscreen.eu) and
Europeana Space (http://www.europeana-space.eu).

1) Check out Lou in Eclipse
2) Build a war using the 'deploy-war' task with the provided build.xml
3) Deploy the war on a Tomcat server

This should be part of a full Springfield install process if that is done correctly you can
visit the url http://[localhost]:[portnumber] and use the admin tools, debugger and application manager.

** best to follow the overall springfield install guide or application development (if you deploy on a hosted springfield cluster) guide (released soon)
